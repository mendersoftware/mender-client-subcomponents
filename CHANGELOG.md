#### Bug fixes


- Clear the inventory data hash on re-authentication
([MEN-7873](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-7873)) ([9d1d579](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender/commit/9d1d579c41137de0328f3a7b2b5de1f406643c1d))  by @jo-lund





- Retry polling on all errors
([MEN-7938](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-7938)) ([45f88a1](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender/commit/45f88a13e6eb1b7e8f4b8c65eba6cccb6030f2b7))  by @danielskinstad






  When implementing the backoff for errors when polling for deployment or
  submitting inventory, we added an exception for unauthorized errors.
  After looking at how it was done in Mender Client 3, we discovered
  that such an exception was not present there, and that the backoff
  should be triggered for all types of errors.
- Fix Mender client getting stuck after failure in sync state
([MEN-7900](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-7900)) ([a97eb04](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender/commit/a97eb04c87e5baab49bbece6f7646505edbceb23))  by @lluiscampos






  From the code point, the issue was that the re-scheduling of new polls
  for updates or inventory were done from the states _after_ the sync
  state, so unless the state machine reached that point the new polls
  would not be scheduled.
  
  Fix by creating two new states, that just do the re-scheduling, between
  idle and sync. Note that the timer(s) have now been moved to the context
  object so that it can be accessed from multiple states (namely, update
  polling and submit inventory states which would need to manipulate the
  timer for exponential back-off retries.
- Compile with Boost 1.87

- Fix deployment on 32 bit systems when rootfs is larger than 4Gb
([MEN-8062](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-8062)) ([8ba599b](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender/commit/8ba599b6ec48b7be9f4e5181593ec8c34d78b271))  by @jo-lund

([MEN-7974](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-7974)) ([d74fba3](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender/commit/d74fba313f3131121c9cc1a8a8e6462691658b3b))  by @jo-lund





- Inventory-geo appears to hang while wget retries many times
 ([dd881e8](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender/commit/dd881e8789c1499c76bf6254d9e6488f9e7ff104))  by @deligatedgeek




- Clear response buffer before every HTTP request
([MEN-8554](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-8554)) ([fc38f8c](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender/commit/fc38f8ca34f185e89d56f3a15e78d8d32d877635))  by @vpodzime






  Otherwise leftover trailing bytes from a previous response may be
  parsed as a beginning of the new response resulting in HTTP
  parsing errors.
- Make mender-inventory-geo work with busybox.wget
([MEN-8548](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-8548)) ([033635a](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender/commit/033635a3eccdd4123dc86b82324ced32bd5f6dd6))  by @michalkopczan




- Use /proc/cmdline for root device detection instead of stat in rootfs update module
 ([f822970](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender/commit/f82297049b44fc40690f05920c9881aea3625417))  by @adbjo





- Add explicit check and handling for aborted deployments
([ME-527](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/ME-527)) ([2f53d85](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender/commit/2f53d853692da5e28ce6bde123a89cd9501e075c))  by @danielskinstad




- Add timeout to prevent hanging downloads on connection loss
([MEN-8717](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-8717)) ([1b51930](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender/commit/1b519306b97cdb5e0a8228f75f8f16c0164ed280))  by @danielskinstad






  If network connection is lost while downloading an artifact, the client
  can hang when calling `beast::http::async_read_some` in `AsyncReadNextBodyPart`.
  Implement an AsyncWait timer that triggers an error handler after 5 minutes.
- Make Update modules generators POSIX compatible
([MEN-8818](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-8818)) ([1202183](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender/commit/1202183572d34b72238f9a0cc5b84f47413e22b0))  by @lluiscampos






- Added warning for invalid NO_PROXY setting containing comma
([ME-586](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/ME-586)) ([9286807](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender/commit/92868077d1c2437c8203de32158d94f3ece422b2))  by @nickanderson






  While proxy variables are not perfectly standardized, if comma isn't
  correct, it's at least a common option, so a good warning will be helpful to users.
- Use correct variable for error message
 ([0a5acd1](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender/commit/0a5acd153b9d18958ea33577fc9b1da9e95a2e0c))  by @thall






  Before wrong variable were used when constructing the error message.
- Sanitize Update Module paths - payload_type must not point outside of Update Modules' directory
([MEN-9027](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-9027)) ([c76f042](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender/commit/c76f042b381e640b7a8903da459bce9e8d8b8028))  by @michalkopczan




- Fix signature size checking
([MEN-9055](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-9055)) ([f7a5968](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender/commit/f7a59687c98e951f632d8744e56c31a62541880a))  by @elkoniu in #1853






  Follwoing the bug report - signature size we are processing
  shall be exact 64 bytes. Other size than that should lead
  to an error.
- Sanitize State Script filenames - paths based on them must not point outside of State Script directory
([MEN-9057](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-9057)) ([5183bb5](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender/commit/5183bb54f04df8152911a76f67389871440c9550))  by @michalkopczan




- Sanitize artifact's payload filenames - they must not point outside work directory when extracted
([MEN-9056](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-9056)) ([f0f3fc8](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender/commit/f0f3fc8d2ce51d29bb8c928b000b7d38fe3b1175))  by @michalkopczan




- Sanitize header list of payloads and corresponding type-info files
([MEN-9098](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-9098)) ([8ab0762](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender/commit/8ab076204cb5421ff09209dc3274b383c3067454))  by @michalkopczan




- Improve handling of arguments in artifact-gen scripts
([MEN-9115](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-9115)) ([fa7f0af](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender/commit/fa7f0afcf461e8934fd147713fc86353a08ff356))  by @vpodzime






  Fix how single-file-artifact-gen and directory-artifact-gen parse
  arguments and pass them to mender-artifact. They need to be more
  careful to prevent injected extra arguments going through the
  script to mender-artifact.
- Strip just header compression extension instead of extensions for all files
([MEN-9146](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-9146)) ([b344dc6](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender/commit/b344dc60c75e70805dffdd0e0f18b0d598f85987))  by @michalkopczan




- Return error when artifact payload contains files not present in the manifest
([MEN-9109](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-9109)) ([3367ada](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender/commit/3367ada2399eb5e027db3191c01a1f4993268c86))  by @michalkopczan




- Use boost beast's tcp_stream object
([MEN-9104](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-9104)) ([2ea7c40](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender/commit/2ea7c40216fb42524ef980910bb15da7a2c86276))  by @danielskinstad






  Scheduled async read handlers from boost beast takes a stream
  object which we close and destroy in error handlers. The issue is that on
  cases where we call the error handler with our custom timeout, we
  destroy the stream object which some async read operations still need
  access to. By leveraging boost beast's own tcp_stream object, we can get rid
  of our custom timeout and set the timeout directly in the object which
  will allow the async error handler to do its job.
- Ensure tcp_stream object doesn't hang
 ([d8ddf6d](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender/commit/d8ddf6da29b9c76eeb68c2711a7508bafacd1701))  by @danielskinstad




- Generate new key in mender-update if needed with embedded auth
([MEN-9132](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-9132)) ([94f8dd6](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender/commit/94f8dd6a0951563b5b8c3289aa222e083d04ebac))  by @vpodzime






  When built with `MENDER_EMBED_MENDER_AUTH`, mender-update cannot
  rely on mender-auth generating a new private key if there is no
  pre-existing one.
- Prevent segfault by correctly handling dbus restarts in mender-update and mender-auth
([MEN-9144](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-9144)) ([43dd888](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender/commit/43dd88881bb5253b0ff7f3f25ccd991b300b4675))  by @michalkopczan




- Schedule next deployment poll if current one failed early causing no handler to be called
([MEN-9144](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-9144)) ([6aa4c77](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender/commit/6aa4c776107ae5b038ced51ecdeee32a8f6b9ee5))  by @michalkopczan




- Add Host header to proxy HTTP CONNECT request
([MEN-9262](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-9262)) ([23e43e7](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender/commit/23e43e700dcc687ac354771b3ab6684e41927ac8))  by @LudvigAnderson





- Make JSONL parsing to deployment log more robust
([MEN-9128](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-9128)) ([39f4a3d](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender/commit/39f4a3d66457a71541acc75496ee602f14d1846c))  by @vpodzime










#### Features


- Add User-Agent header to HTTP requests
([MEN-1979](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-1979)) ([64b0a6a](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender/commit/64b0a6ab091daa720d074edb9b155e2e0e0cbb88))  by @jo-lund





- Add DeviceTier configuration option
([MEN-8650](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-8650)) ([516541d](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender/commit/516541d6d66dabc97a44fb7676dce8570f5cced3))  by @danielskinstad





- Enable YAML CPP by default
([MEN-8650](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-8650)) ([33c2be0](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender/commit/33c2be010379d1bff12f4c3efe36a29d21ed2768))  by @danielskinstad






  Change MENDER_USE_YAML_CPP default from OFF to ON to enable YAML
  support by default in the build. Also remove the separate build
  requirement for YAML tests since YAML CPP is now enabled by default.
- Implement system_type support for System devices
([MEN-8650](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-8650)) ([8b4346b](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender/commit/8b4346bfb9e2eb757d9f37b157c45a61a9c01305))  by @danielskinstad






  System_type is used in two specific cases:
  1) when polling for deployments
  2) when installing manifest artifacts (payload type "mender-orchestrator-manifest")
  
  Regular artifacts (e.g. rootfs updates) continue using device_type even on
  System devices, but note that these are installed through mender-orchestrator
  (through mender standalone mode) since deployment polling uses system_type.
- Send tier in authentication request
([MEN-8636](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-8636)) ([e41dc3e](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender/commit/e41dc3e405f324c0938430178db6f27e54dbbe63))  by @danielskinstad




- Error out on comma in NO_PROXY
([ME-586](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/ME-586)) ([c825b8f](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender/commit/c825b8f433cefd28de3665a48501a80592ae770d))  by @nickanderson






  Instead of warning when the NO_PROXY environment variable contains a
  comma, error out. The warning was easy to miss, and this is an invalid
  configuration that should be reported as an error.
  
  The error message is kept generic to apply to all mender clients that
  use this shared code.
- Delegate `mender_client_version` inventory key to external script
([MEN-9016](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-9016)) ([9bff508](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender/commit/9bff508f7a55040f064bda7b64213544f7438be4))  by @lluiscampos







  Mender Client is introducing a new package/recipe
  `mender-client-version-inventory-script` which will provide the Mender
  Client version not only based on `mender-update` version, but in the
  Mender Client as a whole, as documented in our official docs.
  
  Hence `mender-update` now expects the key to exist, and it will fallback
  to the old behaviour if not present.
  
  A new inventory attribute `mender_client_version_provider` is added to
  distinguish the two cases.
- Add configuration option RetryDownloadCount
([ME-589](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/ME-589)) ([b0b4977](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender/commit/b0b497776f3796e1e9b702e00d104b3be29a3763))  by @michalkopczan

#### Build


- Install `mender-artifact` from final tag on the test container
 ([d9825a9](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender/commit/d9825a979f9777de9e58e5b15b353c0e9a70d997))  by @lluiscampos




  So that we stop using the experimental APT repos, which we should not
  rely on.




#### Refac

## mender-binary-delta master (2026-02-02)

### master - 2026-02-02


#### Bug fixes


- Convert the boot partition numbers to int before comparison.
([MEN-8043](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-8043)) ([99e8d24](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-binary-delta/commit/99e8d2487ab369194959f22a93b63c20141014e3))  by @jo-lund





- Fix segfault when failing to get part number during install
 ([951ed28](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-binary-delta/commit/951ed289a052dcc00b1f4ef4dfb4cc3538c3abb8))  by @lluiscampos






  This was a hidden bug that surfaced now while fixing the support for
  PARTUUID and PARTLABEL. Or, in other words, when handling Mender
  configuration with partitions that do not end with a number. In this
  case pass_num is NULL and xasprintf will try to dereference it.
- Correctly apply deltas with PARTUUID and PARTLABEL configuration
([MEN-7160](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-7160)) ([f146c78](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-binary-delta/commit/f146c786501db209bbfc80785bfe682ec658525d))  by @lluiscampos







  This fixes the bug where mender-binary-delta fails to apply the delta
  when partitions are configured with PARTUUID or PARTLABEL options.
  
  Fixes the issue by first resolving the device symlinks like
  /dev/disk/by-partuuid/*, /dev/disk/by-partlabel/*, and /dev/root to
  their actual device paths (e.g., /dev/sda2, /dev/mmcblk0p2) and then
  extracting the partition numbers.

([ME-530](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/ME-530)) ([f5bea59](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-connect/commit/f5bea591ec7a53700122692764689df4a42ca205))  by @danielskinstad




- Make StopShell function re-entrant by protecting stop channel
([MEN-9029](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-9029)) ([b3fb7ed](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-connect/commit/b3fb7edabae4909cbc361bb2ecc34d8d3b86d770))  by @alfrunes









#### Features


- Lower backoff intervals
([ME-546](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/ME-546)) ([8ce8f78](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-connect/commit/8ce8f78bbf8747ec0cfdfbc0fdcb851ea9b89f75))  by @danielskinstad






  The previous backoff had a starting interval at 1
  minute and a max backoff at 60 minutes. When it reached 60 minutes it
  would linearly increase to 120 minutes minutes where it would keep
  retrying.
  
  The backoff will now start at 1 second and exponentially increase after
  3 retries until it reaches 30 minutes where it will keep retrying.
  For each interval a jitter between 0 and 5 seconds will be added.
- Enable 10 minute idle timeout by default
([MEN-8260](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-8260)) ([15df4b2](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-connect/commit/15df4b2fa9b4806c76f4356583b4bcb084c0ffd2))  by @danielskinstad






  Introduce a default value of 10 minutes to `ExpireAfterIdle` and set
  `StopExpired` to true by default. This is done in order to prioritize
  auto healing of mender-connect over the ability to have a theoretically
  endless session.

## mender-flash master (2026-01-05)

### master - 2026-01-05


#### Bug fixes


- Support flashing more than 4 GiB in 32 bit builds
 ([0031e01](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-flash/commit/0031e0184c0ebefc033e8a5bb3a503ea6bf8cae5))  by @vpodzime






  `_FILE_OFFSET_BITS` needs to be set to 64 so that I/O
  functions/syscalls working with files and devices use 64 bits to
  represent sizes. The `off_t` type needs to be used instead of
  `size_t` in places where file/device sizes and total numbers of
  bytes are used. OTOH, `size_t` is the type used by many I/O
  functions/syscalls which has to be respected.
- Fix UBI device detection
([MEN-7156](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-7156)) ([8100797](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-flash/commit/8100797f2caf6221b9cdea0b8596cb544a97bfc2))  by @vpodzime






  Ported commit b69fa5faf6c43c5037853e2564a81d5c950f0287 to use
  a check based on the `/sys/class/ubi` tree rather than major
  device number which is not guaranteed to be stable.
  
  Also, UBI volumes have character device nodes not block device nodes.
- Do `fsync(out_fd)` before `close(out_fd)`
([MEN-7862](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-7862)) ([5099e88](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-flash/commit/5099e88a1c7a80ff1dcd6cd924ddc4bda87ace7c))  by @vpodzime






  `close()` doesn't guarantee a sync:
  
  > A successful close does not guarantee that the data has been
  > successfully saved to disk, as the kernel uses the buffer cache
  > to defer writes.
- Use shoveling for writing to UBI devices
([MEN-8604](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-8604)) ([8b92ab6](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-flash/commit/8b92ab6eff3d5685befa2ce0eb249f021660f14d))  by @vpodzime






  The nicer and fancier syscalls don't support UBI devices.
  
  OTOH, we do support syncing when using them so let's fix the
  comment in two ways with a single change!
- Fix handling of the '-f' short option
 ([280ea2a](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-flash/commit/280ea2a994ed2f086b1b8407fc11de6bdbb35c57))  by @vpodzime






  `getopt_long()` is called in two places in the code, so all
  options need to be present in both of the calls. Let's avoid this
  in the future by defining a macro and using it in both places.




#### Features


- A minimal and portable version of mender-flash
 ([bd4acbe](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-flash/commit/bd4acbe0b0c21014e5b2435afd50a1de7479f171))  by @vpodzime






  Written in C, much smaller and very straightforward, but doing
  the same thing.
  
  Also much faster to compile/build and with no dependencies.
- Use in-kernel copying on Linux
 ([8aa1e36](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-flash/commit/8aa1e36d87a578e275d849529ac2efb91b885274))  by @vpodzime






  Linux provide syscalls to copy data between two file descriptors
  directly in kernel without using user-space buffers. There's no
  reason to not use them to save some CPU cycles and potentially do
  the I/O in a more optimized way.
- Add an option to specify the fsync interval
 ([450fce0](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-flash/commit/450fce01d974cca80d5dd89b108349b587299733))  by @vpodzime






  And use BLOCK_SIZE as the default.
- Optimize writes by default and let the user force them
 ([1cf25a5](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-flash/commit/1cf25a506a16e32000e8cd795ac4a7486b3a49ed))  by @vpodzime






  Potentially reducing wear of flash memory used as the target
  device and potentially speeding things up if the target device
  has much faster reads than writes.
  
  OTOH, often it's just much faster to write all the data.
- Enable use of sendfile/splice with fsync_interval
 ([65723e1](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-flash/commit/65723e1077a78025ee713fbc8522c550b0e7ee86))  by @vpodzime






  We can simply as kernel to handle at most fsync_interval of bytes
  at once. Still fewer syscalls and no unnecessary user-space
  buffers needed.

#### Bug fixes


- Missing service_ prefix so an incorrect argument is passed.
([MEN-8068](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-8068)) ([5a6b181](https://github.com/mendersoftware/monitor-client/commit/5a6b1814333bb676c32c62bb2d4150445fcf5435))  by @MuchoLucho







  This prints out an empty string for flapping rate/count in the logs. The first argument should have a prefix e.g `service_`.
- Incorrect value for STATUS_BY_LOG_NAME
([ME-474](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/ME-474)) ([fe2f43b](https://github.com/mendersoftware/monitor-client/commit/fe2f43b26f40b5a9634ea83e8483269f1eb8ff2d))  by @nickanderson





- Redirect USB disconnect log to journal
([MEN-8348](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-8348)) ([a515d03](https://github.com/mendersoftware/monitor-client/commit/a515d03fb9bdd42fb45dfe14a6a34081942f40cf))  by @elkoniu






  On Debian Bookworm log file /var/log/kern.log used by USB disconnect
  script is not existing. This commit changes script behavior to use
  journal instead.
- Avoid setting description to an empty string
([MEN-8710](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-8710)) ([165b9a3](https://github.com/mendersoftware/monitor-client/commit/165b9a37735f4750d40cfaddec1eb5139661335e))  by @nickanderson






  This change fixes a case where the log description is set to an empty string. It
  also aligns the variable with alert_description and description elsewhere in the
  script.
  
  Additionally prevented other cases of undesirable empty variables
  
  - status could have been set to an empty string as LOG_ALERT_STATUS is not
    obviously defined
  
  - subject_type would have been set to an empty string as indicated by the if
    condition
- Add warning message about possible log flood
([MEN-7216](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-7216)) ([bb875d8](https://github.com/mendersoftware/monitor-client/commit/bb875d86221c3d6cbcaf5cd5e5c68d8007272879))  by @elkoniu






  By default dbus monitor uses two settings to filter out messages:
  * DBUS_PATTERN
  * DBUS_WATCH_EXPRESSION
  
  When none of them are set result is collecting all possible dbus
  messages. This changes adds a warning message for the user about possible log flood when none of the filters is set.
- Log_usb_disconnect not working with getting started - adjust regex
([MEN-8704](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-8704)) ([1491e9f](https://github.com/mendersoftware/monitor-client/commit/1491e9fe8a11a408cedbbe4efae75c38ed6df15c))  by @michalkopczan






  This is a first in a series of commits fixing the usb log monitoring.
  This commit changes the regex for usb disconnect to a correct one. This makes
  the usb monitoring work in general, but it does not fix an issue where,
  if a monitoring service is enabled after the monitor daemon is already running,
  the new service won't work until monitor damoen is restarted.
- Log_usb_disconnect not working with getting started
([MEN-8704](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-8704)) ([f4eb940](https://github.com/mendersoftware/monitor-client/commit/f4eb940bea1d65d8565e70aca962584013fdd1df))  by @michalkopczan






  USB monitoring was not working with getting started because of 1) the log collecting commands
  were started only once at mender-monitor startup. If "mender-monitorctl enable" was called
  for a log collector that uses a command (as opposed to log file) while mender-monitor was
  running already, the command was not started, and 2) log regex was wrong for use with journalctl.
  
  This commit introduces following changes:
  - starting log collecting commands in a loop
  - monitoring of log collecting commands statuses, and restarting them if needed
  - (*)monitoring of pattern_expiration_worker status from each log_watch_cmd, exiting if pattern_expiration_worker is no longer alive
  - (*)monitoring of log_watch_cmd process status from pattern_expiration_worker, exiting if the log_watch_cmd is no longer alive
  
  * - all exited commands are restarted by the log collecting commands monitoring code
- Mender-monitor occasionally produces malformed entries for false positives
([MEN-8710](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-8710)) ([209f72e](https://github.com/mendersoftware/monitor-client/commit/209f72e08a8611bea96cc54cc4cc9b9afa78dc7e))  by @michalkopczan







  mender-monitor produced a false positive log alert, with only the log pattern visible in
  the alert, instead of "Log file contains (log pattern)". This was caused by incomplete
  reads causing the log expiration monitoring function to treat the incomplete read not as a
  request from the monitoring function to check if a given log pattern is expired, but as a
  new log pattern to be monitored for expiration.
  When the "new" log pattern expired, an OK alert was sent with the malformed message.
  
  Incomplete reads were almost exclusively visible at system startup - probably due to high system
  load. They could also become visible when multiple alerts were being sent in a short time.
  
  Fix introduces incomplete reads handling.
- Added silent flag to curl in alert-lib.sh
 ([34d6af6](https://github.com/mendersoftware/monitor-client/commit/34d6af68296b8cecd81c02e6bb7d08e870ffec0f))  by @MuchoLucho






  There was a `curl` command lacking of `--silent` flag.
  It was affecting the journal with messages like:
  
  ```text

#### Features


- Add `version` argument support to mender-monitorctl
([MEN-8249](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-8249)) ([76987dd](https://github.com/mendersoftware/monitor-client/commit/76987dd1254d39c64b1204d39c74f95ba8f51a17))  by @elkoniu






  This PR adds new `version` argument which can be called standalone
  to obtain ctl tool version.
